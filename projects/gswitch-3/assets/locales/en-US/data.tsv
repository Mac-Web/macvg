$END_DIALOG_1_1_LINE_1	So we meet again.
$END_DIALOG_1_1_LINE_2	 
$END_DIALOG_1_1_LINE_3	I see that your skills have not
$END_DIALOG_1_1_LINE_4	decreased in the slightest.
	
$END_DIALOG_1_2_LINE_1	That was easy!
$END_DIALOG_1_2_LINE_2	 
$END_DIALOG_1_2_LINE_3	I’ll beat whatever you throw
$END_DIALOG_1_2_LINE_4	at me.
	
$END_DIALOG_1_3_LINE_1	Haha! I would not be
$END_DIALOG_1_3_LINE_2	so sure if I were you.
$END_DIALOG_1_3_LINE_3	Let’s see how you do in the
$END_DIALOG_1_3_LINE_4	next set of challenges.
	
$END_DIALOG_2_1_LINE_1	 
$END_DIALOG_2_1_LINE_2	See? Piece of cake!
$END_DIALOG_2_1_LINE_3	 
$END_DIALOG_2_1_LINE_4	 
	
$END_DIALOG_2_2_LINE_1	I feel you are getting a bit
$END_DIALOG_2_2_LINE_2	arrogant, my friend. I’m sure
$END_DIALOG_2_2_LINE_3	that the final set of challenges
$END_DIALOG_2_2_LINE_4	will take care of that.
	
$END_DIALOG_2_3_LINE_1	So much talk, so little action.
$END_DIALOG_2_3_LINE_2	 
$END_DIALOG_2_3_LINE_3	Let’s go, I’m ready!
$END_DIALOG_2_3_LINE_4	 
	
$END_DIALOG_2_4_LINE_1	You had better be.
$END_DIALOG_2_4_LINE_2	 
$END_DIALOG_2_4_LINE_3	The next level is not for the
$END_DIALOG_2_4_LINE_4	faint of heart.
	
$END_DIALOG_3_1_LINE_1	YES!!!!!!
$END_DIALOG_3_1_LINE_2	 
$END_DIALOG_3_1_LINE_3	I did it!!!
$END_DIALOG_3_1_LINE_4	 
	
$END_DIALOG_3_2_LINE_1	Bravo! I must admit that
$END_DIALOG_3_2_LINE_2	I did not think you would
$END_DIALOG_3_2_LINE_3	make it this far.  Your
$END_DIALOG_3_2_LINE_4	performance was outstanding.
	
$END_DIALOG_3_3_LINE_1	You were able to combine
$END_DIALOG_3_3_LINE_2	lightning-fast reflexes with pinpoint
$END_DIALOG_3_3_LINE_3	accuracy in double-body conditions.
$END_DIALOG_3_3_LINE_4	A truly remarkable feat.
	
$END_DIALOG_3_4_LINE_1	If you haven’t already, you
$END_DIALOG_3_4_LINE_2	may further challenge yourself
$END_DIALOG_3_4_LINE_3	in Endless mode or local
$END_DIALOG_3_4_LINE_4	Multiplayer with friends.
	
$END_DIALOG_3_5_LINE_1	The experiment will continue
$END_DIALOG_3_5_LINE_2	when the time is right.
$END_DIALOG_3_5_LINE_3	 
$END_DIALOG_3_5_LINE_4	Until then…
